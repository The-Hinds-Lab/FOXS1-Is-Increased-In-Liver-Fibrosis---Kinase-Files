# FOXS1-Is-Increased-In-Liver-Fibrosis---Kinase-Files
This repository is associated with the Journal of Biological Chemistry publication titled: "FOXS1 is Increased in Liver Fibrosis and Regulates TGFÎ² Responsiveness and Proliferation Pathways in Human Hepatic Stellate Cells"
There are two folders with input data for each kinase family analysis: STK (serine-threonine kinase) and PTK (protein-tyrosine kinase). These raw data files were used to generate all of the data included in the manuscript.
